# MNIST-using-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Neural-Networks
This code block implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and split into training and testing sets. The MLP neural network is trained using different numbers of hidden layers and neurons, with the logistic function as the activation function. The performance of the network is evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports. The code also visualizes some of the input images and their predicted labels.

The code can be used as a starting point for building a more advanced neural network for handwritten digit recognition.
